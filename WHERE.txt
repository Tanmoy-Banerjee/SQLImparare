WHERE CLAUSE 
The WHERE clause is used to filter records which fulfill a specific condition.

Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Demo Database: Refer https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp 

The following SQL statement selects all the customers from the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';

Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields  
-----------------------------------

SQL requires single quotes around text values however numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes.
Example - SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID=1;
